**Ruby:** A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/

**Cucumber:** Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software should behave in plain text. The text is written in a business-readable domain-specific language and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid - all rolled into one format. http://cukes.info/

**Capybara:** Capybara helps you test web applications by simulating how a real user would interact with your app. It is agnostic about the driver running your tests and comes with Selenium support built in. https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara
